# helloworld
My first repository on GitHub

I am excited to start diving into git and hope to move to JavascriptMVC soon.
My name is Will Hampton, I am a student in the GIS application specialist program at Fleming College in Lindsay, ON, Canada.
I have been learning Python, C#, and Javascript and am eager to continue on this path.
While I don't have much experience with coding, it has proven fairly intuitive to me and I don't plan to stop learning more.
